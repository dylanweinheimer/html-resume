<h2>Tabletop Roleplaying</h2>
    <p>From Dungeons & Dragons to Cyberpunk Red, if I get to create thrilling and hilarious stories with my friends<br/>
        I am in. I started the hobby several years ago now and while I do not get to actively participate in it often, I<br/>
        love every second I am playing, and I have actively sought out new roleplaying games over the years, with a<br/>
        personal collection of 10+ unique games and 30+ prewritten adventures.
    </p>
<h2>Board Games</h2>
    <p>While this hobby has a lot in common with tabletop roleplaying it is a far more attractive option to the average<br/>
        person, so I often find it easier to participate in this, which has led to an even more extensive (and expensive)<br/>
        collection forming over the years.

<h2>Retro Game Repair</h2>
    <p>This hobby is relatively new, I just started within the last year and have little experience with it so far, but the<br/>
        experience I do have has been eye opening. I started with taking my childhood gameboy and seeing if I could get<br/>
        it up and running again, after disassembling it, cleaning all the parts and replacing a few minor components I<br/>
        was able to turn it on and get it to read games again. Which launched me head first into a new hobby I never<br/>
        expected, repairing game cartridges and other devices, with the eventual goal being to completely modify these<br/>
        old devices to have rechargeable batteries, LED screens, bluetooth audio, and more.
